                            <h3>Buyers</h3>
                            <p>Buyers can browse book inventory by searching in the "Browse" tab. Searches can be done by book name, ISBN, author or by scanning the barcode of the textbook. The results shown from book searches are filtered by location (Univerity or mile radius). Buyers can then choose either to "Buy Now" or add the textbook to cart for checkout at a later point in time. When the book has been purchased a message with the book seller will be instantiated in order to setup a book exchange.</p>
                            <h3>Sellers</h3>
                            <p>Sellers can use the "Sell" tab and either search for the name of the book they would like to sell or scan the barcode of the book. Once the book is entered and found in the database, the remaining book information is autofilled (ie. Author, Edition, Title, ISBN, etc.). Sellers can then set their price to sell the textbook competively. The app will show the current average price for the same textbook used as well as other prices listed by other users for the same book. We will also provide you with the price that the book was last sold for. We want your book to sell so we provide you with as much information as possible.</p>

                            <p>We aim to launch the app at the end of August. We are planning to run a beta version of the application at Boston University as well as a few other select Universities which have yet to be determined.</p>

                            <p>One of the exciting features of reBooks is that the student gets complete control over what he or she will charge for the book. We plan to provide real time price data to help guide the student on what the average price for the book is currently, but ultimately the student will have the final say in the price of the book.</p>

                            <h3>Feeling Ripped off.</h3>
                            <p>It’s no secret that college students are fed up with being ripped off by the exorbitant prices of college textbooks. Our product is a mobile application that allows students to buy and sell used college textbooks from each other. Our application is a faster and more economical choice than the current alternatives that students have today. Using the functionality that all phones have today, students will be able to search for, buy and sell used college text books. And because our application is localized, students can quickly meet up to complete the transaction.</p>
