Vo = R / (R + 10K) * Vcc // R is the variable resistance provided by the thermistor

We are using a resistance of 9.1k ohms

Vo = R / (R + 9.1K) * Vcc

Vcc = 5V

Vo = R / (R + (9.1*10^3)) * 5

ADC value = R / (R + 9.1K) * 1023

R = 10K / (1023/ADC - 1) 

Use the opbtained value to calculate the temperature

Implement the reading in the Steinhart-Hart equation :

Also use Vcc = 3.3v, the above equations are indepedent of this term. So both 5v and 3.3v work. But 3.3v is less noisy.
