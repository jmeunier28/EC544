A button is added to the node ( Arduino + thermistor ).

This is done so we can toggle between transmitting and non - trasmitting modes.

Setup :

One leg of the button is connected to the 5V pin on the shield.

One leg of the button is connected to the ground through a 10K ohms resistor.

Third leg is connected to one digital pin - Digital pin 2 used in this implementation.

When the button is pressed it closes the circuit, the digital input pin reads a HIGH.

When the button is not pressed the circuit is open and the digital input pin reads a LOW

Adding an LED :

The output pin 13 is connect to a resistor and the long end of the LED is connected to the other end of the resistor.
The short end of the LED is connected to the GND pin on the board.
