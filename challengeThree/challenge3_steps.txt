Update pi
enable remote access to router
generate public encryption key and add to router
added diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 crytography protocol to /etc/ssh/ssh_config (on laptop- off by default)
(tried to do without security, but both above steps seem to be required- just times out otherwise)
can now http or ssh to router (hop #1)
	web: http://<outgoing_ip>:8080
	ssh: ssh root@<outgoing_ip> -p 2222
create noip hostname
configure noip service on website
configure noip settings in router ddns config
install & configure noip client on pi
add noip2 to /etc/rc.local
add dhcp reservation for pi on router

EDIT:
 
Got direct ssh from remote computer to pi without having to do two hops (to router first) using open-ssh server. 
(sudo apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client)
Set up port forwarding from port 5555 to port 22

Tested by disconnecting my laptop from the BU network and connecting it to my phone's WiFi hotspot.


ssh pi@grp4router.ddns.net -p 5555
password: pw
cd ~/EC544/challengeThree
node led_mod.js

Trying to do 2nd ssh hop from router -> Pi:
	"Error: no matching algo kex"
	This means that I'd have to add diffie-hellman to the router's ssh because
	openssh on the pi-side uses it, but the problem is the routers file-
	system is read-only. So rather than edit the firmware and reflash it to the
	router I decided to just use telnet to make the 2nd hop.
install telnet on pi
test telnet from Pi to router:
$ telnet 192.168.1.1 user: root pw: admin  (working)
telnet from router to pi:
	telnet 192.168.1.134 (SUCCESS)
export TERM=xterm

full commands to turn LED on from a mac connected to 802.1x WiFi:
0- First time setup for each laptop: have to generate and pair public key + add missing crypt settings
	ssh-keygen -t rsa
	enter (no passphrase)
	enter
	copy /etc/ssh/id_rsa.pub
	add to router remote admin ssh daemon public keys
	reboot router
	concat:
	 KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nist$
	to /etc/ssh/ssh_config on mac (as sudo)
1- ssh root@grp4router.ddns.net -p 2222
2- telnet 192.168.1.134
3- cd ~/Desktop/code_challenge3
4- node led.js : send on signal to arduino
5- ctrl+C (or quit): send off signal to arduino

Can turn led on Arduino on/off with my laptop or my phone connected to any network.
